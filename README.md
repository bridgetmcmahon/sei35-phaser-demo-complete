# Phaser Demo

Hi SEi35!

I've included a completed version of this tutorial so you can see what it looks like when you've got the scoring and bombs working.

Highly encourage you to play around with some of the values (velocity, gravity, number of stars...whatever you want really).

I'm in the GA mentor channel if you want to hit me up with any questions - look for `bridget-mentor`!

## Full tutorial

The full tutorial lives on the Phaser.io website here - https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1.
